# X-ray_Absorbance
Simulator of X-ray absorbance as a function of composition.  Gives edges and plots absorbance over some energy range.

These materials were developed for Biophysics 401 at the University of Michigan to illustrate EXAFS spectra from 2 shells of scatterers and to be used with a set of active learning exercises.
